# Android - CKC Portfolio - Kotlin (alpha) [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/truongpx396/ckcportfolio.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/truongpx396/ckcportfolio)
CKC stands for "Clean architecture - Kotlin - Cryptocurrency". This project is just for learning purpose, and still being under development, I was inspired by blockchain technology for initial motivation in doing this project.
* The design of app is mimicked from [Blockfolio App][7].
* The architecture is based on android clean architecture principles which was implemented and shared by Fernando Cejas. A special thanks to Fernando Cejas, he did a great job there, take a look in [Architecture Android Reload][8].
* Written in kotlin, a very powerful and concise progamming language in my opinion. 
* Being powered up by Android jetpack and take advantage of android architecture components features, these knowledge I've learned from [Android Sunflower App][9] .

## Android - Jetpack - Java
------------
Android Jetpack is a set of components, tools and guidance to make great Android apps. They bring
together the existing Support Library and Architecture Components and arranges them into four
categories:

Libraries Used
--------------
* [Foundation][0] - Components for core system capabilities, Kotlin extensions and support for
  multidex and automated testing.
  * [AppCompat][1] - Degrade gracefully on older versions of Android.
  * [Android KTX][2] - Write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code.
  * [Test][4] - An Android testing framework for unit and runtime UI tests.
* [Architecture][10] - A collection of libraries that help design robust, testable, and
  maintainable apps. Start with classes for managing UI component lifecycle and handling data
  persistence.
  * [Data Binding][11] - Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements.
  * [Lifecycles][12] - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.
  * [LiveData][13] - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
  * [Navigation][14] - Handle everything needed for in-app navigation.
  * [Room][16] - Access app's SQLite database with in-app objects and compile-time checks.
  * [ViewModel][17] - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule
     asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
  * [WorkManager][18] - Manage Android background jobs.
* [UI][30] - Details on why and how to use UI Components in apps - together or separate
  * [Fragment][34] - A basic unit of composable UI.
  * [Layout][35] - Lay out widgets using different algorithms.
* Third party
  * [Retrofit][92] for network requests
  * [Dagger2][93] for dependency injection
  * [Firebase][94] for cloud services
  * [Glide][90] for image loading
  * [Kotlin Coroutines][91] for managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks
  * [Mockito][95] for mock test data
  * [Roboletric][96] for test android components without the need for an emulator device

## Local Development
This project uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the
`gradlew build` command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.

Here are some other useful Gradle/adb commands for executing this example:

 * `./gradlew deployDebug` - Builds and install the debug apk on the current connected device.
 * `./gradlew runUnitTests` - Execute all unit tests.
